Make an array of all 26 letters of the alphabet (lowercase).
Make a variable that will randomly pick one of the 26 letters as a secret letter.
Setup a keyboard event on the whole body.
If the key you pressed is the secret key, you should append "SECRET KEY PRESSED"
to the body in a tag of your choice.
After the secret key is pressed, 
randomly pick another secret key and assign it to your secret key variable.
